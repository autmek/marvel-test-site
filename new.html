    YOUR FULL LIST OF ALL UPCOMING MARVEL MOVIES — WITH KEY DETAILS!
</h2>
<p>
    Since Marvel Studios present Kevin Feige first introduced the notion of Phases 
    to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, their purpose and length have always been mysterious. 
    Sometimes, he even reconsiders where they begin and end after the fact. But with Marvel 
    Studios presentation at Comic-Con International: San Diego 2022, the exact length and purpose 
    of Phases Four, Five, and Six were revealed during a presentation notable for just how much 
    information the often evasive Feige was willing to offer. For one thing, the three phases form 
    the next Marvel epic: The Multiverse Saga. And like The Infinity Saga before it, it will build 
    from a phase of character introductions (the recently concluded Phase Four) to something full
     of war, dynasties, and secrets.
<br><br>
    Of course, the introductions are far from ending. Also, on the horizon is the arrival of the 
    anti-hero team known as the Thunderbolts and, of course, Marvel’s first family, the Fantastic Four. 
    And as we have for the last few years, we’re keeping track of it all in this comprehensive guide of 
    every upcoming Marvel Studios film (and television show) with a handy calendar of the studio’s 
    projects through 2026 (and beyond).
